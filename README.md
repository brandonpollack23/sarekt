# Sarekt

## Overview

This is my third attempt to make something in Vulkan.  I think I've accumulated enough knowledge and 
wherewithal to make something worthwhile.

This is a renderer that has Vulkan first as it's backend that I want to keep relatively low level.
I think it'll expose a lot at first, and slowly begin wrapping this again in another wrapper 
I'll call "Shran", another Star Trek character.

Shran wrapper.  Get it?

## Usage

This readme is minimal.  Cargo doc is your friend.  This is far from done.

## Name
"Sarek" is the Vulcan father of the character "Spok"  of Star Trek.
